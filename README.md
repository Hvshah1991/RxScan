### Description

RxScan – helps the user to check doctor prescriptions. It’s converts handwritten
prescriptions to legible text and runs a medicine search to find details and other
alternative for the drug. Basically, it cross-checks from medical database (National
Library of Medicine) if the prescribed medicine is recognised. This will promote safe
drug (medicine) use. Additionally, it also provides the user ability to keep reminders for
the medicine usage.

### Problem

My mother recently had a severe injury which led to going to multiple appointments
with MDs. This leads to numerous handwritten prescriptions from doctors. The problem
is that it’s difficult to read these prescriptions and the pharmacist can make mistake.
Even, we as a patient are not aware what medicines we are taking and what medicine
will be good for us knowing our pre-existing conditions. This personal problem led me
to research more into this global problem.

According to NIH, handwritten medication prescriptions still represent a common
practice in hospitals worldwide. For example: India (currently highest population in the
world) still have handwritten prescriptions. Experts say that up to 25 percent of
medication errors may be related to illegible handwriting: A pharmacist misreads an
illegible prescription; one drug is mixed up with another.

Pain-points:
• Medication Error
• Inconvenience for patient
• Potentially Life threatening, if wrong medication followed
• Lack of understanding and knowledge for patient can make it frustrating
